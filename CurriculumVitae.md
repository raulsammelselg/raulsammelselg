## Summary

I am Raul, born and raised in Estonia, currently living in Tallinn. I learned programming briefly at school and liked it so much I started learning more of it on my own, finally after graduating landing a job as developer/programmer in a company with a good team. The team wasn't as experienced as I had hoped, so I started working/learning from the job and tasks handed to me. I have learned a lot from the job and I am still learning. I desire to advance in my life, take on new challanges, learn from different kinds of people who have different perspectives. I am a fast learner and I am not afraid to ask questions, also a good team player and can work alone if needed. I am looking for a position where I am able to expand my knowledge and expertise, and contribute to the success of the company and my coworkers.

I would consider my strengths to be:

- Fast learner, able to learn new things quickly and independently
- Team player, willing to help others and teach
- Good at teaching others
- Problem solving skills
- Finding solutions to complex problems

My weaknesses:

- I am not good with git messages and naming things
