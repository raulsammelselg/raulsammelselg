## Summary

I am Raul, born and raised in Estonia, currently living in Tallinn. I learned programming briefly at school and liked it so much I started learning more of it on my own, finally after graduating landing a job as developer/programmer in a company with a good team. the team wasn't as experienced as I had hoped, so I started working/learning from the job and tasks handed to me. I have learned a lot from the job and I am still learning, but I feel like I need a change of pace and a new environment to learn from. I am a fast learner and I am not afraid to ask questions, I am also a good team player and I can work alone if needed. I am looking for a job where I can learn and grow as a developer/programmer.

I would consider my strengths to be:

- Fast learner

- Problem solving
- Finding solutions
